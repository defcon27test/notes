Commit to Analysis
	- Why Think About Thinking?
		- Different Perceptions


ch33r10:
			Psychology of Intelligence - Rishard Hugher

			Short-term/working memory impacts how we function and design, etc.

			We can all be biased
			Unlearning is Harder!!
			No substitution for experience
			

			What kind of analyst do you wanna be?
			
			Logical Fallacies and Cog Bias

			Cause/Effect
			Physical Properties vs. Anything else
			Things don't necessarily correlate from one discipline to another
			
	
			Analogy
			Again not every correlates

			Probability 
			Just bc many alerts are false pos doesn't mean the next one will be
			
			Anecdotal
			"My experience is more important" - fallacy

			
			Anchoring
			Analysts relying on the first bit of info they see - research shows that this can lead to missing things
					"Use 'empty mind'" and slow down when making decisions
			Confirmation Bias
					"Use analytic thinking and 'mental models'"
			Fomr Hugher: Analysts should be more conscious of their mindsets

			CTI Mindset as a Technique
			

			_Break down problem in easily digestible parts

			**took picture** 

			AM I JUGGLING MORE THAN 7 +/- 2 THINGS?
				For me, its probably 3 or 4


			Make a PAPER checklist: shown to be beneficial. 

			Think in Graphs, not Lists.
